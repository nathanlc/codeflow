# CodeFlow

## General instructions
Read README.md to understand the context of this project.

## Code standards
### Clean up after making changes:
- remove dead code
- fix lint errors
- format the code
When a linter says that e.g. a variable isn't used. Prioritize removing the code if possible rather than prefixing the variable with an underscore.
