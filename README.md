# CodeFlow
A collection of tools to understand a codebase through interactive visualization.

## The problem
Understanding a codebase you're not familiar with is not straightforward.

## Features

### Code Glimpse
Get a glimpse of a codebase. See its file structure at a glance.

### Code Canvas
Dive in the implementation. Jump through symbol definitions and see their connections on a canvas.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all
```

### Development
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run dev:frontend  # Frontend on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:backend   # Backend on http://localhost:3001
```
